    <h1>Padma Rivers</h1>

    <p id="p01">
        Padma River, main channel of the greater Ganges (Ganga) River in Bangladesh. For some 90 miles (145 km) the Ganges River forms the western boundary between India and Bangladesh before it enters Bangladesh at the northern edge of the Kushtia district as the upper segment of the Padma River.
    </p>

    <h4> Geography </h4>
    <p>The Padma enters Bangladesh from India near Nawabganj and meets the Jamuna near Aricha and retains its name, but finally meets with the Meghna near Chandpur and adopts the name "Meghna" before flowing into the Bay of Bengal.
